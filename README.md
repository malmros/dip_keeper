dip_keeper
==========

an openSCAD file for 3D printing a "keeper" for the Atmel 8 pin DIP ATtiny13a
based on Karl Lunt's FireFlyLED project (as a "minimal" micro processor){http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/fireflyLED.html}
this 3D design captures the 8 pin ATtiny13a together with an LED and a 10M ohm resistor. 
It fits inside a section of 3/8" ID clear vinyl tubing (Lowe's) which also
becomes a battery holder for two button cells hacked from an A23 battery.
